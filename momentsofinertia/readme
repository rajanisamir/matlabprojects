After becoming interested in rotational dynamics when taking a calculus-based physics course, my multivariable class went through how to go about deriving the “moment of inertia,” also known as the rotational inertia of objects through multiple integrals. The moment of inertia of an object is defined as its resistance to rotation, just as mass, or linear inertia, is an object’s resistance to translational motion. I find it interesting how the rotational resistance of a certain infinitesimally small unit of mass is proportional to the square of its distance from the axis of rotation. Upon learning how to derive moments of inertia, I wrote up the code to do so for a rod about its end and central axis, as well as for a hollow and solid disk about its center, the last of which requires a polar double integral. I realized, however, that while a program that computed these was useful, the moments of inertia for the objects have already been derived. I then expanded my code to be able to solve for the moments of inertia of linear objects with non-uniform mass distributions. This project was immensely helpful in teaching me how to utilize MATLAB’s built-in integration capabilities, as well as how to derive the moments of inertia for objects with given mass distributions. I feel this project could be very helpful for engineers attempting to build highly precise structures, but the personal satisfaction of getting to see how it would work and the learning experience made it worthwhile.
