Harmonics Project Reflection

Having played piano for the majority of my life, and given my passion for math, I was naturally inclined to finding out how the theory behind music works. For my most code-intensive project, I wrote code to visually represent and compare harmonics, as well as calculate ratios between the vibrational frequencies of strings to demonstrate the operation of fundamental frequencies and how they lead to notes “sounding good” together.  For example, if the second harmonic (nth harmonic simply being a formal way of saying “n times the fundamental frequency”) on one string produces the same tone as the third harmonic on another string, the two notes are separated by a musical interval known as a “perfect fifth,” and will sound beautiful together. However, dissonance can also be created; the 16th and 15th harmonics being the same on consecutive strings will result in a half-step, which, when played, is displeasing to the ear. While I encountered many complications in getting the program to work, I eventually figured out how to accurately display absolute value graphs of the wave patterns and calculate the frequencies with some odd workarounds. This project was not only helpful in teaching me more about music theory, which gave me further insight into the music I love playing and listening to, but it also taught me some of the more interesting functions in MATLAB, such as “extract before” and “extract after,” which I used in conjunction with the drop-down menus. I also learned a significant amount more about MATLAB and its app designer and graphing interface.
